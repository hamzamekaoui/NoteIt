# NoteIt

NoteIt is a simple, completely offline note-taking application.

I know... there are already dozens, probably hundreds, of solutions providing almost the same functionality, so here is another one :p.

NoteIt is an application I enjoyed building throughout my React learning journey that I will use for my needs.
